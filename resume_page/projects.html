      <li>Becoming Nature Boy:<span>Surviving a plane crash, I was told I would never wrestle again. Through rehabilitation, I was able to step back into the ring, however, I could not be the powerhouse wrestler I once was. I had to adapt, and so, after defeating Buddy Rodgers, I was honored with the right to become Nature Boy. </li>
      <li>NWA Heavyweight Champion:<span>I first held the belt after defeating Dusty Rhodes in 1981. I held the belt for two more years before being defeated by Harley Race. His reign was shortlived, however, because you can bet that Nature Boy regained that belt in the same year, and held it for eight more. WHHHOOOOO!</li>
